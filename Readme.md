# Ansible on Windows

**Ansible and Windows are sitting in a tree and p-r-o-v-i-s-i-o-n-i-n-g!**

# Why?

Have you ever had to install Ansible on Windows instead of a lovely Linux machine?
And you'll need to install it if you want to simply ```vagrant up``` with the Ansible provider enabled.
Let's skip this step and spin up multiple connected virtual machines. Thereby we can use one instance as the ```[master]``` and the others as the ```[slave]```.

# Dependencies

- [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
- [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/)
- If it's impossible to run 64-Bit boxes, you could change the ```Vagrantfile``` to ```"precise32.box"```

# Installation

    $ git clone https://github.com/meggesje/vagrant-ansible-windows.git
    $ cd vagrant-ansible-windows
    $ vagrant up [master|slave]

# SSH

It'S important to know that you have to generate and submit your ```id_rsa(.pub)``` on your own for now. Or you could force the standard vagrant passwords in your ansible configuration.

I'd like to recommend to use PuTTY to connect to one of the instances.
You could even convert the %HOMEPATH%\.vagrant.d\insecure_private_key to .ppk with a tool like PuTTYGen and use it in your PuTTY session. Since Vagrant will forward the box ssh port to 2222 (or 2200; just look a the boot prompt) you have to use this port instead of the standard ssh port ```22```.
